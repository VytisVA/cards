      <h3>If you're working on a predefined task</h3>
      <p>Read the task carefully and understand what it is asking you to do.</p>
      <h4>Examples</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The README suggests this should be a command line application, so no website required.</li>
        <li>The task guidance asks me to always present numbers in the form <code>Â£0.00</code>, so I will make sure to do that.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>If you're working on your own idea</h3>
      <p>Refine the idea down into something you can build.</p>
      <h4>Examples</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I wanted to build a web app of some kind to improve my web development skills. After thinking about it, I decided
          to build a notes app.</li>
        <li>I wanted to do something fun and interesting. After throwing some ideas around, I decided to build a web-based PacMan
          clone.
        </li>
      </ul>
