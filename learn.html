      <h2>Read & Refine</h2>
      <h3>If you're working on a predefined task</h3>
      <p>Read the task carefully and understand what it is asking you to do.</p>
      <h4>Examples</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The README suggests this should be a command line application, so no website required.</li>
        <li>The task guidance asks me to always present numbers in the form <code>£0.00</code>, so I will make sure to do that.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>If you're working on your own idea</h3>
      <p>Refine the idea down into something you can build.</p>
      <h4>Examples</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I wanted to build a web app of some kind to improve my web development skills. After thinking about it, I decided
          to build a notes app.</li>
        <li>I wanted to do something fun and interesting. After throwing some ideas around, I decided to build a web-based PacMan
          clone.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Start a timer for 15 minutes</h2>
      <p>If it goes off before you complete <strong>Implement</strong>, jump to <strong>Revert</strong></p>
    </article>

    <article class="card-section">
      <h2>Plan</h2>

      <p>Work out what you're going to do, and do any planning necessary.</p>
      <h3>Keep it small</h3>
      <p>You will need to plan, write the test, and make it pass in 15 minutes or less.</p>
      <h3>Think from the user’s perspective</h3>
      <p>If possible, your task should be from the user's perspective, for example:</p>
      <h4>Good</h4>
      <p>The user makes a deposit and then sees it on their bank statement.</p>
      <h4>Bad</h4>
      <p>I add a class with a deposit method and a print statement method.</p>
      <h3>Use diagrams to clarify your thinking</h3>
      <p>This is a good time to draw some diagrams.You might want to figure out the objects that you will use to break up your
        solution, or a process diagram to get the sequence straight in your head.</p>

    <article class="card-section">
      <h2>Test</h2>

      <p>Write a test for the piece of functionality you are about to add.</p>
      <h3>Test from the user’s perspective first</h3>
      <p>Think about how the user will use it and write the test from that perspective. Don't create any classes or do any implementation
        work until you’ve done that.</p>
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <code><pre>
it "prints a statement with one deposit" do
  bank = Bank.new
  bank.deposit(1000)
  expect(bank.print_statement).to eq "1000"
end
</pre></code>

    <article class="card-section">
      <h2>Implement</h2>
      <p>Make the test pass.</p>
      <p>Your whole test suite should be green by the end of this step.</p>
      <h3>Do the simplest thing that could possibly work</h3>
      <p>Don't think too far ahead.</p>
      <p>Hard-coding it is acceptable — you can plan more versatile behaviour in the next planning step.</p>

      <h2>Refactor</h2>

      <p>Improve the code without changing what it does.</p>
      <p>Try these strategies</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Running a linter and resolving all the warnings.</li>
        <li>Look for large methods or classes and break them up.</li>
        <li>Check your test descriptions for clarity and correctness.</li>
        <li>List out the responsibilities of each of your classes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Look through your code and make a list of everything you like about it.Then look through again and make a list of everything
        you don’t like.</p>
      <p>Improve the things that you can right now. Everything else, make a note of as an area to read up on or ask someone
        about.
      </p>

    <article class="card-section">
      <h2>Commit</h2>
      <p>Commit your changes.</p>
      <h3>Write a descriptive subject line</h3>
      <p>Phrase your message as if you were explaining briefly what you’ve been doing since the last commit.</p>
      <!-- The above could be better, consider adding in "A properly formed git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence: If applied, this commit will" -->
      <h4>Good</h4>
      <p>Extract a Weather class out of Airport</p>
      <h4>Bad</h4>
      <p>Did some general refactoring</p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>If you add a blank line beneath the commit subject you can add a description.You can use this area to give more context
        or to reflect upon what you did and any thoughts you might have about it.</p>
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <pre>Extract a Weather class out of Airport

I realised Airport had responsibility for landing
planes and determining the current weather. I thought
this violated the Single Responsibility Principle so I
created a new class and some unit tests. Now Airport is
smaller and more focused.</pre>

        <h2>Now head back to plan and do another cycle</h2>
        <p>The cards below are for if your timer goes off.</p>
      </article>

    <article class="card-section">
      <h2>Revert</h2>

      <p>Revert to the last commit that passes the tests.</p>

      <p>You can do this with
        <code>git add .  && git stash</code> The 15 minute rule</p>
      <h3>The 15 minute rule</h3>
      <p>You should play this card if it has been more than 15 minutes since you started planning.</p>
      <p>This is the most important card in the whole deck.</p>
      <!-- <- clearly not true -->
      <p>By halting after 15 minutes and trying something simpler, you avoid going off on tangents or picking tasks tasks too
        big to tackle at once.</p>
      <p>It also helps you refine your process and reflect. Each time you revert you will notice things you do slightly differently.
        Over time, you can keep the things that work, and drop the things that don’t.</p>

    <article class="card-section">
      <h2>Simplify</h2>

      <p>Take your previous plan and make it simpler.</p>
      <h3>Try these strategies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Doing fewer things at once.</strong>
          <br> E.g. if you’re trying to set up a web server with a database, try just setting up the web server.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Solving a smaller version of the problem.</strong>
          <br> E.g. if you’re making a 10x10 game board, try making a 2x2 one.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hard-coding something</strong>
          <br> E.g. if you’re trying to send an SMS with the current time in it, try sending the SMS with a fixed time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can re-add the complexity in a future iteration.</li>
