          small steps.”</p>

      <p>We’ve helped thousands of developers get their first job. Over that time we've learned a thing or two about what can hold developers back, as well as what can propel them forward.</p>

      <p>These cards are designed to help you develop an effective process for making software. They break down your craft into eight separate activities, each with their own role to play.</p>

      <p>If you often find yourself at the end of a long day of programming without achieving as much as you'd like — these cards are for you.</p>
