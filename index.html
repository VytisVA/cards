    <p>Hi! It’s Kay here.</p>

    <p>So you’ve chosen to share some of your learning with a fellow developer. That’s great! You might be saving them days
      or even weeks of frustration, and helping them reach their goals. It makes me happy to think about that!</p>

    <p>This is a guide to help you give them the main pointers, but you should feel free to pass on your wisdom as you go.
      The great thing about the cards is you can use them so many different ways, and I’m sure they’ll want to know all
      about it.</p>

    <p>You’ll need:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This guide (nice!)</li>
      <li>A set of cards to give them (there are eight)</li>
      <li>A computer</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You’ll also want to have used the cards recently, so it’s fresh in your mind.</p>

    <h2>The kickoff</h2>
    <p>Sit them down and spread out the cards on the desk. Demonstrate that the cards match up by colour. Explain that they
      are designed to help structure your approach to programming, to avoid going off on big tangents or not getting as
      much done. Talk a little about how they’ve come in useful for you.</p>

    <p>Explain to your friend that the rule is you can only do the activity on the last card you put down — so if you put
      down the
      <strong>Plan</strong> card, you’re /only/ allowed to do the
      <strong>Plan</strong> activity until you’ve completed it.</p>

    <p>Go through the six main cards and explain what they’re for. Here’s a reminder:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Read & Refine</strong>. Read the task you’ve been given, or refine your own task down to something defined.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan</strong>. Decide on a 15-minute chunk to do and plan roughly how you’ll do it.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Test</strong>. Write a test for the functionality you’re going to add.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Implement</strong>. Make the test pass.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Refactor</strong>. Reflect on and improve the code.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Commit</strong>. Commit your changes.</li>
      <li>Then back to
        <strong>Plan</strong>!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then talk about the timer. Another reminder:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start the 15 minute timer right after putting down the
        <strong>Plan</strong> card.</li>
      <li>Stop it right after putting down the
        <strong>Refactor</strong> card.</li>
      <li>If the timer goes off before you get there, slam down the
        <strong>Revert</strong> card.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Revert</strong> all your changes since the last commit.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simplify</strong> to pick a smaller or simpler step.</li>
      <li>And back to
        <strong>Plan</strong> with your new simpler task.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you say ’revert’ to them they’ll probably wince. It’s not always easy to play that card! Explain how it keeps
      you from going off track, and keeps you focused on exactly the tricky problem or challenging learning opportunity
      you need to work on. If you fancy it, explain a little bit about the zone of proximal development.</p>

    <p>If they still seem distressed, tell them about <code>git add . && git stash</code> as a way to revert while still keeping the
      code around to look at.</p>

    <h2>The exercise</h2>
    <p>The best way to learn how to use something is to see someone use it and then try it yourself!</p>

    <p>Pick an exercise to do with your friend. Try to keep it inside their comfort zone — we want them focusing on the cards
      for now. A few ones I’ve found useful are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The bank tech test</li>
      <li>A twitter clone</li>
      <li>A battleships game</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Start with them navigating and you driving. Prompt them to use the cards as the navigator to guide the process. Don’t
      forget the timer!</p>

    <p>Depending on how much time you have, you might want to just do the first cycle or two, or keep going to complete the
      whole thing. Don’t shy away from offering your experience!</p>

    <h2>Booster topics</h2>
    <p>If they come up, dropping in the following booster topics can help make their process even better.</p>

    <h3>Thinking from the user’s perspective</h3>
    <p>When you’re in
    <strong>Plan</strong> or
    <strong>Test</strong>, ensure you think from the user’s perspective — not yours. That means thinking about how the user interacts
    with the program, not about how you’ll organise your data!</p>

    <p>A good example:<br>
    The user makes a deposit and then sees it on their bank statement.</p>

    <p>A bad example:<br>
    I add a class with a deposit method and a print statement method.</strong>

    <h3>Using diagrams</h3>
    <p>Especially in
    <strong>Plan</strong>, but also throughout, you’ll benefit from drawing stuff out. Try these:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sketching out the user interactions (even for command line apps!)</li>
      <li>Diagramming how you’ll organise your objects</li>
      <li>Drawing a sequence diagram to figure out your methods</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Be careful though — especially at the beginning you can get caught up doing too many class organisation diagrams. I rarely
    do them until I’m a few cycles in to development. Keep it simple and focus on the user.</p>

    <h3>Simplification</h3>
    <p>It’s not always obvious how to make something simpler, and sometimes people feel like they’re cheating! Don’t worry about
    that, no one’s going to fire you for solving problems in simple chunks rather than all at once. Here are a few techniques:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Doing fewer things at once.</strong>
        <br> If you’re trying to set up a web server with a database, try just setting up the web server.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Solving a smaller version of the problem.</strong>
        <br> If you’re making a 10x10 game board, try making a 2x2 one.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hard-coding something</strong>
        <br> If you’re trying to send an SMS with the current time in it, try sending the SMS with a fixed time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
    <p>You’re done! Check in with them in a week or two to see how it’s all going.</p>

    <p>Thanks for sharing your experience with them! Part of the tradition of software engineering is passing on your knowledge,
      and if you haven’t taken your place in that already — now you have.</p>

    <p>And next time someone asks you about the cards — consider sending them to your friend.</p>
