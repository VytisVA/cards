        <p>Work out what you're going to do, and do any planning necessary.</p>
        <h3>Keep it small</h3>
        <p>You will need to plan, write the test, and make it pass in 15 minutes or less.</p>
        <h3>Think from the userâ€™s perspective</h3>
        <p>If possible, your task should be from the user's perspective, for example:</p>
        <h4>Good</h4>
        <p>The user makes a deposit and then sees it on their bank statement.</p>
        <h4>Bad</h4>
        <p>I add a class with a deposit method and a print statement method.</p>
        <h3>Use diagrams to clarify your thinking</h3>
        <p>This is a good time to draw some diagrams.You might want to figure out the objects that you will use to break up your
          solution, or a process diagram to get the sequence straight in your head.</p>
